# Doom Text Astro component

This is a Doom Text generator component for [Astro](https://astro.build/).
You can use it to add images that contain text using fonts from the classic
video game DooM.

The text generator idea is coming from [Eevee's doom text generator](https://github.com/eevee/doom-text-generator/).
 I ripped assets from that repo. If you like this visit [Eevee's patreon](https://www.patreon.com/eevee).

Copying the legal warning verbatim from that repo. Take care.

> Most of the included fonts are commercial works extracted from commercial
> products, and I do not have permission to use them beyond the general air of
> quietly-tolerated remix culture in the Doom community and the fact that vanilla
> Doom requires a level graphic. C'est la vie.
